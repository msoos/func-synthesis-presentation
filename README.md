# Slides for "Boolean Functional Synthesis and its possible application to Cryptography"

## Abstract
Boolean Functional Synthesis is a very powerful tool to create functions out of
declarative problem descriptions. Given constraints in conjunctive normal form
(CNF) and a set of inputs and outputs, a boolean functional synthesis engine
provides a circuit that calculates the output bits in terms of the input bits.
This can be used to e.g. synthesize a function for planning e.g. robotics
tasks, but also to e.g. reverse circuits, or parts of circuits, in particular
ones that describe cryptographic functions
